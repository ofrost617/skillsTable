# Candidate filtering exercise

Separated out index.html into main.css, index.html and index.js. 

Created indexSpec.html to test in the browser using Jasmine Standalone.

Added js code to filterCandidateBySkill() to allow JavaScript candidates to be filtered.

Implemented additional features to allow selection of a skill from a dropdown menu, leading to the display of a table containing cnadidates who have that skill.
